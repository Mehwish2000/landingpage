          <h2>Behavior</h2>
          <p>
            Elephants’ skin is thick, wrinkled, and not very hairy. It is
            grayish to brown in color. An elephant’s trunk is an extension of
            the nose and upper lip. An elephant uses its trunk to grab food and
            to put it into the mouth. It can also draw water into the trunk and
            then blow it into the mouth.African elephants may stand up to 13
            feet (4 meters) at the shoulder. The Asian elephant may reach about
            11.5 feet (3.5 meters) at the shoulder.

            Humans have used elephants for transportation and as work animals
            since ancient times. Some people still use elephants for these
            purposes today. In addition, circuses throughout the world used to
            train elephants to perform for audiences. However, many people think
            elephants should not be used in these ways anymore. They think it is
            cruel and unfair to the elephants. The animals were often mistreated
            in order to get them to perform.Today there are several sanctuaries
            for elephants around the world. A sanctuary is a place where animals
            are protected.
